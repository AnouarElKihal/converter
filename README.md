# Converter
In this program you have the option to choose the conversion option from the menu that will appear in the terminal. 
There are several functions to convert binary code to something else or vice versa. 
In addition there is also the option to convert a color image to gray or sepia. 
In the folder you can add images (jpg or png), but remember that you also need to edit the name within the code.
# gray image
> rows:
> 88 e 115 -> if the image in the folder is of type jpg;
> 124 e 151 -> if the image in the folder is of type png.
# sepia image
> rows:
> 171 e 202 -> if the image in the folder is of type jpg;
> 210 e 241 -> if the image in the folder is of type png.
